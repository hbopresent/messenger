## What is messenger

messenger is a chat app which is build by html/css and javascript.
This shows how it feedbacks to user. For example what the reply effect feels like or what's the feedback when you are waiting for the response.  


## Why I do this

I'd like to build beautiful and something dynamic interface. And I got the idea from two apps I always use. They are facebook messenger and LINE. So I combine both features to create this new app and hope you like it.
